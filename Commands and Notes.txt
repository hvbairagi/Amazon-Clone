firebase emulators:start

firebase init -> functions -> javascript -> y -> y
then the functions folder appears and this is the full backend
functions folder has its own node-modules, index.js, etc... 
it is like another project in your project
if you do npm install at any point now, make sure you are inside the functions folder... otherwise
you are going to install things in your app and not in backend

stripe publishable api key  (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)



firebase deploy --only functions  // deploying only backend
// if fails you should update to firebase to Blaze not Spark
// https://console.firebase.google.com/project/clone-e8235/overview
// grab url in cloud functions

firebase deploy --only hosting   // to prevent deploying cloud functions  (hosting is the front-end)


// if index.html contents rewrites change the firebase.json
// delete the rewrites part
